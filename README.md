# The Bitwave: Wavefunction Emergence from Zero Entropy

The `Bitwave` class combining both the classical bitstring and the quantum wavefunction, fusing them into a single emergent entity.

## What is a Bitwave?

A **Bitwave** is a finite binary string that, through internal structure alone, gives rise to:

- Complex amplitudes (via internal encoding)
- Phase relationships
- Probabilistic behavior
- Entropic growth over time
- Emergent resolution (precision scales with entropy)

There is no external wavefunction imposed. All dynamics emerge **purely from the bit pattern**.

## How Does It Work?

At zero entropy, the Bitwave is a string of identical bits (e.g. `"000000"`). As bits flip, structure emerges. Interference, superposition, and amplitude variation are interpreted from patterns in the bitstring, not from a separately imposed Hilbert space.

Key properties:

- **Amplitude**: Derived from blockwise structure within the bitstring.
- **Phase**: Emerges from local differences between blocks.
- **Entropy**: Computed from pattern complexity (e.g., Shannon entropy).
- **Resolution**: Increases naturally as entropy rises; not externally imposed.

## Why Is This Powerful?

It removes the need for predefined physics. Instead:

- Reality begins as pure information (`""` or `"000..."`)
- Physics emerges as an *interpretation* of structured information
- The Bitwave is the minimal simulation-compatible unit of physical description

This perspective aligns with your foundational principle:
